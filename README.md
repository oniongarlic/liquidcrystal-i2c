C++ i2c LCD library
===================

C++ i2c LCD display library for Linux devices using the i2c device nodes.

Based on the "New LiquidCrystal" library from https://bitbucket.org/fmalpartida/new-liquidcrystal/

Only the i2c functionality is kept from the arduino original library, there is no support for
other methods of accessing the LCD screens.
